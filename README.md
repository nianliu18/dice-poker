Dice Poker Project Nov 9th 2017


In Poker Dice the hands consists of Pairs, Two Pairs, Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, and Five of a Kind! Two players get five dices each and they shake. They go heads up and see who has the bigger hand! What makes it fun is that each player get one rubuttal chance. 
If player one gets higher hand in the first shake. Player two gets a crack at beating the current hand and vise versa. He/She selects which dice he/she wants to keep out of their five dices and they shake the rest. Example:(Keep pair 2's and shake rest of dices) If player two wins with his/her rebuttal, player one gets to use his/her rebuttal chance. Remember every player gets one chance to beat a winning hand. Win or Lose all depends on the second shake. Strongest hand after their second chances wins!
