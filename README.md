Dice Poker Project Nov 9th 2017


In Dice Poker there are two players that each hold 5 dices each. Possible combinations each player can have is nothing(meaning no combinations), pairs, two pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, and five of a kind! Each player has one rebuttal(second chance) and shakes their dice at the start of the game. 

How rebuttals work is: the player with the lower hand either nothing or a lower combination, picks the die or dices they want to keep and shake the rest hoping to get something higher than their opponents. 

Example:
Each player's goal is to try to get a poker combination that is bigger than the others. If player one gets a higher combination than player two, player two selects which dices he wants to keep and shakes the dices he doesnt want using their second shake. If player two ends up getting something bigger than player one, its player ones turn to use his/her second shake to beat players two's combination. Lastly if each player gets nothing in their first shake, and gets nothing in their rebuttal shake. They both end in DRAW! 

Sounds like a lot to take in! But trust me, play a couple of rounds and you'll get the hang of it!
