logic

p1 shakes and p2 shakes
if player =higher hand, player lower hand shakes
if lower player hand > higher player -higher player shakes
run compare function if turns = 4

if p1 shakes then p2 shakes run compare function. whoever higher, lower turn.
if second rolled > then other p shakes if < other p wins.

if p1 turn =1 and p2 = 1 run compareFunc
if hb1 > hb2 p2 shakes, if p2 > p1 run compare function p1 shake.

p1 keeps dices he wants
p2 keeps dices he wants.
if p1 > p2 , p2 shake again.
if p2 > p1 , p1 shake again.
if p2 reshake > p1, p1 reshake
if p1 reshake > p2, p2 reshake
after all possible second shakes, compare values

compare function:
p1 roll-but1 {if p1 turn = 2 compareFunc}
